# Assigning categories to messages from telegram channels

We have a file with pre-labeled categories of messages from a dark telegram with a dubious subject. The code in datas.py reads this data, produces a text file with the most frequent words in the messages themselves. The other two functions read this text file and assign a new category to messages that have not been marked up.
